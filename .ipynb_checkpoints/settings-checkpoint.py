Novels always follow a five-part format, with each part having 6 chapters for a total of about 30 chapters in a novel:
1.) Status Quo (Situation at the Start) - The first chapter must capture readers with immediate action, intrigue, or drama, introducing the protagonist in a memorable way. Following this hook, major supporting characters are introduced through interactive scenes that organically reveal their:
- Essential personality traits and quirks
- Core motivations and desires
- Complex relationships with other characters
- Personal stakes in the coming conflict
These character introductions should weave together, creating a rich tapestry of relationships and potential conflicts. The section concludes with the emergence of the main plotâ€”an seemingly insurmountable obstacle or dramatic event that threatens to upend everything established. This problem should raise multiple story questions that will keep readers engaged.

2.) Inciting Incident (What Disturbs the Status Quo) - This section follows the protagonist dealing with immediate consequences of the main conflict, while introducing a "ticking clock" element that creates urgency. Key elements include:
- Escalating complications that make the protagonist's situation increasingly dire
- Introduction of the antagonist through their own perspective
- Development of the antagonist's motivations, which should be relatable and understandable
- Clear establishment of major consequences if the protagonist fails
- Building reader anxiety about the protagonist's fate through mounting pressure
The antagonist's introduction should make readers think, "Under different circumstances, I might agree with them." Their opposition to the protagonist should feel organic rather than forced.

3.) Developments (What Happens Next) - This section shows the protagonist formulating and executing plans to overcome the main conflict while dealing with the antagonist. It should include:
- Initial small victories that build confidence
- New complications that arise from these victories
- Growing tension between supporting characters as pressure increases
- Evolution of relationships and alliances
- Increasing stakes that make each decision more crucial
The protagonist's progress should feel earned but precarious, with constant reminders that failure remains possible. This section builds tension through a series of escalating challenges and partial successes.

4.) Crisis (How Things Come to a Head) - This is the climactic section where all plot threads and character arcs converge into a final confrontation. It should feature:
- A moment where the protagonist must make a seemingly impossible choice
- The highest stakes yet, with personal and public consequences clearly defined
- Testing of all relationships and alliances established earlier
- Revelation of any hidden motivations or secret plans
- A situation that forces characters to show their true nature
The crisis should feel inevitable in hindsight but surprising in the moment. It must challenge the protagonist's core beliefs or values, forcing them to either change or double down on their convictions.

5.) Resolution (How Things Resolve) - The resolution shows the aftermath of the crisis and its impact on all characters. Key elements include:
- Clear consequences of the protagonist's choices during the crisis
- Resolution of major plot threads and character arcs
- Demonstration of how characters have changed (or refused to change)
- Addressing of thematic questions raised throughout the story
- A sense of closure while potentially leaving room for future stories
The resolution should feel satisfying but not necessarily happy. It must show how the events of the story have transformed the world and characters, while reinforcing the story's central themes. The ending should echo back to the beginning in some way, showing how far things have come.

Additional Writing Guidelines:
- Maintain consistent pacing throughout each section
- Ensure each scene serves multiple purposes (plot advancement, character development, world-building)
- Plant seeds early for later developments
- Use varying scene lengths and structures to control tension
- Balance action with reflection
- Keep subplot resolutions connected to the main conflict
- Ensure character growth feels organic and earned"""
