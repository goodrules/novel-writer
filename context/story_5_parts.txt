# Notes on the main story
## Part 1 - Status Quo
- Garrett and his 2 best friends, Dillon and Brent, are childhood friends and prodigies in both the physical and magical sciences.  They have just completed post-graduate studies for magic and engineering and have started as Thaumarchaeologists, working under a renowned magic professor, Dr. Asher Reed, who was friends with Garrett’s father and is now Garrett’s mentor (and father figure)
- Garrett, Dillon, and Brent are also top tier duelists.  3v3 magic duels are prominent in academia, professionally, as well as in unsanctioned events
- Garrett's mother Marie has shifted to purely theoretical physics since Michael's disappearance
- Towards the end of part 1, an old keepsake is given to Garrett from Dr. Reed, in which contains something unexpected from Garrett's father

## Part 2 - Inciting Incident
- The hidden, digital copy of Michael's journal contains seemingly random bits of Michael's research, but the group is able to deduce that Michael Brand was investigating the intersection of AI, physics, and magic, and possibly the discovery of a new type of magic
- Vera Black is moving pieces behind the scenes in parallel, using access to her own knowledge of Michael's research.  She is tipped off that Garrett has found Michael's personal research journal, and sends her son Jason to retrieve it
- Jason is an incredibly powerful magic user, skilled in both spells and auras, as well as a genius intellect for engineering
- Garrett’s fathers journal leads them on a chase through Germany and the Czech republic, seeking what they eventually discover to be the Golem, a magical application of artificial intelligence, enabled by the use of sigils (this is the new form of magic that Garrett’s father believed to exist)
- The team discovers Michael Brand had found evidence of early "programming" in ancient magical artifacts
- Marie Brand, seperately, realizes her quantum and AI research might be the missing piece to completing Michael's work

## Part 3 - Major Developments
- Vera Black emerges from the shadows, revealing she's been manipulating magical research and discovery for decades
- Vera wants sigil technology not to democratize magic, but to create a system where she can control who has access to magic.  She has knowledge of Rabbi Loew's other texts, as well as an ancient device, that removes ones ability to utilize magic
- Jason learns the full truth about his parentage during a confrontation with Vera, and how Vera had a hand in Michael's presumed death
- Garrett's team and Jason work together to stop Vera, their combined knowledge of their father's work proving crucial
- Jason starts to suspect he's on the wrong side

## Part 4 - Crisis
- Marie and Dr. Reed nudge Garrett to use his physics knowledge alongside his magic and discovers the truth about sigils, found to be the ability to program and store magic into objects
- While Brent, Dillon, and now Jason, hold off against Vera's forces, Garrett and Nora are able to activate the Golem
- They quickly discover the Golem has a mind of its own, being deactived similar to being asleep, and recognizes Garrett's energy as the same as his fathers unbeknownst to Garrett

## Part 5 - Resolution
- The Golem, determined to be sentient and friendly towards Garrett because of his father, sacrifices itself to destroy the magic negation device, allowing for Garrett, his friends, Jason, Marie, and Asher to escape, while also foiling Vera's plans
- Vera also escapes, the group doesn't know where
- Garrett and team begin postulating the ramifications of sigils, and see a bright but uncertain future ahead
