# Narrative Inspiration: 
- Sigma Force series (James Rollins)
- Red Rising (Pierce Brown)
- Lies of Locke Lamora (Scott Lynch)
- League of Legends / Arcane (magic and non-magic users, hextech)

# World setting:
- Modern day earth, but magic has been discovered and leveraged for roughly the past 1000 years.  Technological innovation still mostly occurred as not everyone on Earth is a magic-user, however there were parallel magic innovations occurring throughout history.
- Individuals who can access magic are referred to as "weaved"
- Individuals who cannot access magic are referred to as "unweaved"

# Notes on the Magic system:
## Schools of Magic
- Spells, abilities that cast outward to another thing
- Auras, abilities that cast inward on yourself or vicinity of one’s self
## Application of Magic 
- Magic typically requires a “focus”, or an item that channels magic efficiently for the magic user, such as a wand, rod, ring, stave, amulet, etc.
- Some magic-users who are exceedingly powerful don’t need a focus
- Magic users can use both types, but typically specialize in only 1 as each requires very different skills, time to master, information/input/resources, etc.
- Magic Education employs a heavy emphasis on magic as well as physics-like systems, such as thermodynamics, chemistry, astrophysics, etc., alongside magic history, technique, and application

# Notes on Thaumarchaeology and Its Disciplines:
- Thaumarchaeology is the scientific study of ancient magical practices, artifacts, and societies through material evidence. Like its conventional counterpart archaeology, it employs rigorous methodologies while requiring specialized knowledge of magical theory, physics, and historical context. The field encompasses several distinct but interconnected disciplines, each focusing on different aspects of humanity's magical past.
## Core Disciplines
### Artifactory
- The study of magical objects, tools, and constructed elements from past civilizations. Artifactors specialize in the analysis, preservation, and understanding of magical artifacts.
#### Key Areas of Study:
- Ancient foci and their construction methods
- Magical material composition and decay
- Authentication of historical magical objects
- Preservation of unstable magical artifacts
- Mapping of magical energy residue in artifacts
#### Notable Discoveries:
- The Baghdad Capacitor (believed to be the first attempted magical energy storage device)
- The Antikythera Mechanism's thaumaturgical components
### Magical Praxeology
The examination of historical magical techniques, methodologies, and technological development. Praxeologists focus on understanding how magic was performed and how magical knowledge evolved over time.
#### Key Areas of Study:
- Evolution of spellcasting techniques
- Historical magical education and training
- Development of magical notation and documentation
- Cross-cultural magical practices
- Lost or obsolete magical techniques
#### Notable Discoveries:
- The Three Schools divergence in the early Bronze Age
- Evidence of prehistoric aura manipulation
- The Great Library's hidden grimoire chamber
### Thaumasociology
The study of how past societies integrated magic into their cultural, political, and economic systems. Thaumasociologists examine the social implications and organizations of historical magical practice.
#### Key Areas of Study:
- Magic user/non-magic user historical dynamics
- Magical governance and regulation through history
- Cultural attitudes toward different schools of magic
- Trade networks for magical goods and knowledge
- Religious and spiritual aspects of historical magic use
#### Notable Discoveries:
- The Magical Merchant Guilds of the Silk Road
- Evidence of non-magic user participation in ancient magical rituals
