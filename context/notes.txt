Michael and the rest of the weaved disappeared during the investigation, however Gunter did not.  Michael and the rest we're pulled through a dimensional rift due to their inherent connection to quantum forces.

- Sigils, the major discovery in the first book, realizes that these patterns can be magically imprinted onto objects, and can be activated by anyone who knows how.  The magical ability required to use sigils is significant, as is the knowledge of quantum physics to know how to manifest and store magic.
