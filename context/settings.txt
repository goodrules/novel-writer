# Notes on critical locations:
- The Blackwell Institute of Thaumaturgical Sciences (BITS), Cambridgeport, Massachusetts - Founded in 1683 as one of the world's first formal institutions combining magical and scientific education, the Blackwell Institute has shaped the fundamental understanding of how dark matter manipulation interfaces with conventional physics, leading to breakthroughs like the first documented stable antimatter containment spell and the theoretical framework for modern quantum-magical computing. The Institute's distinctive granite and glass towers in Cambridgeport, erected through a combination of traditional masonry and sustained levitation spells, have housed some of history's most influential weaved and unweaved scholars, including six Nobel laureates and twelve Merlin Prize recipients for magical innovation. Today, BITS remains at the forefront of magical-technological integration, with its graduates being highly sought after by both research institutions and private industry for their unique ability to bridge the gap between traditional spellcraft and cutting-edge technology.  Programs include School of Fundamental Magic, School of Thaumarchaeology, and School of Integrated Studies.  Named after Elizabeth Blackwell, a 17th-century weaved scientist who pioneered the systematic study of dark matter manipulation and its applications in both magic and early scientific theory.
- Michael Brand’s Abandoned Lab - The abandoned lab was a relic of Michael’s past, frozen in time from when he was last there. Dust covered every surface, and the air was heavy with the scent of decay and forgotten experiments. Shelves that once held meticulously organized scientific and magical instruments were now in disarray. Notes scrawled on whiteboards faded over time, and the remnants of complex machinery lay scattered across the floor. A faint hum, a residual echo of Michael’s magic, resonated from the center of the room, hinting at the powerful work that had once taken place within its walls. The lab exuded an aura of both profound genius and tragic loss, a place where groundbreaking discoveries were made and secrets were buried.
- Old New Synagogue, Prague - The Old New Synagogue rises from Prague's Jewish Quarter, its Gothic spires piercing the misty air since 1270. Behind weathered stone walls and beneath steep gables, shadows dance across Europe's oldest active synagogue. Its timeworn attic holds centuries of whispered secrets, while the foundations descend into darkness where, some say, powerful artifacts rest undisturbed. The synagogue's austere medieval architecture belies the mystical energy that seems to pulse through its ancient stones, drawing seekers of both historical and esoteric knowledge to its doors.
