# Notes on Characters:
## Garrett Brand (protagonist)
- Weaved (can access magic)
- One of the few magic users proficient in both spells and auras, hides the fact that he doesn't require the use of a focus
- Most don't know his expertise in auras, as he doesn't use them often
- Also a prodigy in physics and math, but relies heavily on his magic, much to his mother's chagrin
- Recent graduate of The Blackwell Institute of Thaumaturgical Sciences (BITS) in Magical Praxeology and Spell Dynamics
- Jason's half brother, unknown to Garrett and Jason
- Cares deeply for Nora, but always seems too busy or preoccuppied to act on it
- Reckless but intelligent, has a habit of following his gut but being right about it more often than not; Able to see patterns that others cannot, likely a result of watching his father work and research growing up, which focused on discovering new physical and magical interactions; Intensely protective of his friends and family, he will put himself in harm's way to make sure everyone else is ok

## Jason Black (initial antagonist)
- Weaved (can access magic)
- AKA Jason Brand
- Garrett’s half brother, unknown to Garrett and Jason
- Thinks his father abandoned him, but in reality his mother Vera hid their relationship from him
- Molded from childhood by her adoptive mother's ruthless training, Jason was shaped through isolation to view sentiment as weakness and relationships as mere transactions. His unwavering code of honor, established during his early training with Dr. Reed – never breaking promises and always settling debts – exists alongside a warped morality that justifies any means to an end. Though he maintains a calculated exterior, genuine acts of kindness create cracks in his armor that he desperately fights to suppress

## Brent Hodges
- Weaved (can access magic)
- Garrett’s childhood friend
- Recent graduate of The Blackwell Institute of Thaumaturgical Sciences (BITS) in both Spell Dynamics and Artifactory Research
- Generally cheerful, light-hearted, and go with the flow, he’s always been the gravity that pulls other friends in; Comedic relief, which helps him and others overcome otherwise tense and / or dangerous situations; Booksmart and well-studied, but lacks some of the intuition that sometimes puts Garrett in the limelight

## Dillon Dreyer
- Weaved (can access magic)
- Garrett’s childhood friend
- Recent graduate of The Blackwell Institute of Thaumaturgical Sciences (BITS) in Historical Magic Studies and Aural Studies
- Cautious, timid, but with a sneaky level of intelligence due to his eidetic memory, he is always the careful one; Plays the role of devil’s advocate to Garrett and Brent’s usual impulsive and grand ideas, but never leaves them Garrent and Brent behind; History buff, specifically history of modern magic and ancient magical myths and folklore

- Wields charm and social prestige as weapons, maintaining a sterling public image through strategic philanthropy and calculated kindness.

When wronged, she dismantles opponents through subtle manipulation and strategic character assassination, always maintaining an appearance of innocence. Her greatest pleasure lies in watching adversaries destroy themselves while she observes from a comfortable distance

## Gunter Mannheim
- Unweaved (cannot access magic)
- Was the navigator for Michael's expedition.  Only survivor or didn't disappear.  
- Marie Brand doesn't initially trust him as his outward demeanor is not the friendliest and she partially blames him for her husband's disappearance, even though he was the one who tried to save the expedition
- Hard-nosed, gruff, but ultimately fair man. He’s known as an expert forger of magical relics and has an expansive knowledge of magical antiquities. He has a strict personal code of ethics, but is willing to work with people he normally wouldn't, provided that their interests do not conflict with his. 
- Values discretion above all else, and is a bit of a recluse, preferring to work alone, in his workshop, or in the forests surrounding his property near Prague. He has a deep understanding of magic history, and can often see things others cannot. His gruff exterior hides a keen sense of humor, and he has a dry wit that often catches people off guard. While he might seem standoffish at first, he is ultimately loyal to those he deems worthy.
- Stocky man, with a rugged appearance. He has a full beard and a weathered face that bears the marks of years spent outdoors. He often wears practical clothing that is suitable for his work.
