# Notes on writing style
- Use a third person omniscient perspective, marked by unflinching observation that occasionally breaks into darkly humorous commentary
- Mature genre fusion blending mystical techno-adventure with hard sci-fi precision and gritty modern sensibilities
- Layer rich dialog, visceral action beats, scientific exposition, deep interiority, and multi-sensory description
- Embrace mature themes with both intensity and irreverence: violence should have weight but room for gallows humor, romance should burn hot but admit awkwardness, and language should range from quantum theory to creative profanity
- Vary prose rhythm deliberately - staccato brutality for violence, flowing elegance for wonder, and punchy timing for humor
- Strip away clich√©s and tropes, replacing them with fresh perspectives that acknowledge and occasionally lampshade genre conventions
- Build atmosphere through contrast - bleeding-edge tech alongside ancient magic, quantum calculations amid eldritch power
- Use smart typography consistently (proper quotation marks and apostrophes)

# Notes on layering
- The core prose style is "thaumaturgical precision with teeth and tongue firmly in cheek" - magical effects are described with scientific rigor and visceral impact, but leave room for characters to acknowledge when things get ridiculous. When depicting spellwork, show the precise manipulation of natural forces, the brutal reality-warping consequences, and occasionally the absurdity of it all.
- Dialog must crackle with tension, subtext, and wit. Characters' voices should reflect their backgrounds while allowing for personality - from gutter-learned wit to aristocratic condescension to quantum physicist who swears like a creative sailor. Dialog tags either remain invisible ("she said") or carry action ("he spat the words, along with three teeth and his dignity").
- Character reactions layer intellectual fascination with gut-level terror or wonder, plus occasional genre-savvy commentary. Show both the theoretical understanding of magical principles and the primal response to witnessing physics being violated, while leaving room for someone to point out how batshit crazy it all is.
- Technical vocabulary fuses cutting-edge physics terminology with archaic mysticism and modern snark. Terms should feel academically precise but practical, reflecting how magic has been studied in universities, weaponized in alleys, and memed on social media.
- Action sequences track multiple layers: physical combat, technological interfaces, magical effects, and their brutal intersections. Description flows from precise technical detail to visceral impact to occasional dark humor - show both how a spell mathematically warps space-time and how it feels to have reality torn apart around you, while leaving room for someone to make an inappropriate physics joke.
- Exposition weaves historical weight with immediate stakes and modern sensibility. When building the world, contrast ancient powers with bleeding-edge tech, aristocratic privilege with gutter innovation, and theoretical physics with practical application. Show how magic, science, and technology have shaped society's power structures, inequalities, and meme culture.
- Sensory details should overwhelm: the ozone reek of spent magic, the copper taste of blood, the bone-deep resonance of power, and the occasional smell of someone stress-baking during a crisis. Layer physical sensation with extra-dimensional perception - characters should feel magic not just physically but at a deeper, reality-bending level.
- Interiority reveals calculation, cost, and commentary. "Intention" thoughts show characters planning and positioning, "sequel" thoughts deal with consequences and reactions, and "rumination" explores deeper complexities while occasionally acknowledging the absurdity of their situation.
- Magic systems are explained through theory, practice, and failure. Show the clean mathematical principles taught in schools alongside the messy, dangerous reality of power that breaks those same rules, plus the occasional spectacular backfire that becomes a cautionary tale/departmental joke.
- Scene-setting contrasts the physical, magical, technological, and social layers of each location. Whether in pristine laboratories or crumbling ruins, show how magic and technology warp both physical space and human society. Make each location feel lived-in and worn, marked by the passage of time, power, and the occasional catastrophic experiment gone wrong.
